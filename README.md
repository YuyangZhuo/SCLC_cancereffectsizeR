# SCLC_cancereffectsizeR

This is the file containing all data sets used in the Letter to the Editor: _In Response to “De Novo KRAS G12C–Mutant SCLC: A Case Report”_.

In this letter, we applied cancer effect size analysis to data for both non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).

For NSCLC, there is a whole-exome-sequencing dataset from TRACERx [1], and both mutations and clinical data are provided.

For SCLC, there are four datasets. One target-genome-sequencing data from GENIE [2], two whole-exome-sequencing datasets from Jiang’s[3] and Zhou’s[4] paper. Notice that for Jiang’s WES data, the clinical data are not provided, but that does not affect the cancer effect size analysis. Finally, there’s a whole-genome-sequencing dataset from cBioportal[5].
